I take the course from https://www.dabeaz.com/compiler.html.  
The course was taught by David Beazley using Python. 

I think it is fun to rewrite the code in Golang.

## TODO 
- [x] refactor code. It is almost totally translate Python to Golang.
    Such like the implement of context. Do golang have good way to do it?
